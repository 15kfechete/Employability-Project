application up and running.

### What is this repository for?

In an ever-increasing digital age, organisations throughout the world have had
no choice to modernise and transition in the way they deliver their product or
service to their customers. For this reason, services which rely on software,
web applications or native mobile applications must provide supporting software
and an interface to their customers that is well designed, easy to use and
provides real value to delivering the service/product in question.

For this reason, the basis and purpose of this project will consist of
developing and improving an existing piece of web application software for a
real-life client, Payment Shield Ltd who sell and facilitate insurance products.
A web-based customer portal, named Paymentshield Plus is the core of their
service were customers can login, make a claim, view and download insurance
documentation and provide supporting evidence for live insurance claims. As per
the live brief presented by the client further improvements to the
functionality, usability and design of the customer portal will be developed in
a wish to improving customer experience and ongoing customer retention.
